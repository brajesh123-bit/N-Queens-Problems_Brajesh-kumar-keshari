# N-Queens-Problems_Brajesh-kumar-keshari
The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. The goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. This means that:

No two queens should be placed in the same row.

No two queens should be placed in the same column.

No two queens should be placed in the same diagonal (both major and minor diagonals).

This problem is significant in algorithmic studies because it demonstrates backtracking, an efficient technique used to solve constraint satisfaction problems. The problem has applications in various domains, including artificial intelligence and optimization problems.
